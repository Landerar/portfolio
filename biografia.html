            Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time. This morning, shortly after 11:00, comedy struck this little house on Dibley Road. Sudden, violent comedy. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose. Hey! Your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished with you!<br>

            That's what being a Protestant's all about. That's why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for anyone who respects the individual and the individual's right to decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his protest up to the church door in fifteen-seventeen, he may not have realised the full significance of what he was doing, but four hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear whatever I want on my John Thomas...<br>

            I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Oh, oh, I see! Running away, eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off!<br>

            We're no strangers to love
            You know the rules and so do I (do I)
            A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
            You wouldn't get this from any other guy
            I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
            Gotta make you understand
            Never gonna give you up
            Never gonna let you down
            Never gonna run around and desert you
            Never gonna make you cry
            Never gonna say goodbye
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
            We've known each other for so long
            Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
            Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
            We know the game and we're gonna play it
            And if you ask me how I'm feeling
            Don't tell me you're too blind to see
            Never gonna give you up
            Never gonna let you down
            Never gonna run around and desert you
            Never gonna make you cry
            Never gonna say goodbye
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
            Never gonna give you up
            Never gonna let you down
            Never gonna run around and desert you
            Never gonna make you cry
            Never gonna say goodbye
